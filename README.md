# Class-Based-Components  
## Day 39  
Working now an older method of constructing components which is Class Based Components instead of function components. After that i will be working with State Events and how they interact with Class Base Components. My Users.js file then looks like this ![Screenshot_3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90603989/175991710-68d6d869-97b5-43a5-a9dc-6dc026976e0a.png)  
## Day 40  
Today i will be working on the lifecycle methods that are in action, the context of the class-based components and finally the error boundaries and how to work with them.
